# My Linux Desktop Configuration files

## Description

This is for a arch linux user to set up a `rust`, `python`, `haskell`, `ocaml` and `flutter` development environment with zsh.

## How to use

You should read the `set-up-new-env.sh` file and `update-all.sh` first, if you are satisfied with the effect, run the former script once and the latter script every day.
