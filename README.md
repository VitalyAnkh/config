# VitalyR's Arch Linux Dotfiles

## Description

This is my `.config` for an Arch Linux machine.

## How to use

I don't intend to allow this to be deployed on a fresh machine now. Just copy & paste the useful configs, especially the emacs configs.

For a full-fledged dotfiles manager, I recommend to use [nix home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager).
