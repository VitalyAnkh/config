# My Linux Desktop Configuration Files

## Description

This is for a arch linux user to set up and update `rust`, `python`, `haskell`, `ocaml`, `idris`, `emacs`, `agda`, `flutter` and `nodejs` development environment with zsh.
Besides, this also builds `servo`, `rust-analyzer`, `idris2`.

## How to use

You should read the `set-up-new-*.sh` file and `update-*.sh` first. If you are satisfied with the effect, run the former script once and the latter script every day (to keep them update to date every day). Or you can set a timed task using "crontab" or "systemd".
